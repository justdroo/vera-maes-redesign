Built mobile first,  relies on BootStrap v. 3.3.5 and JQuery v. 1.12.2


STYLE:

Each page has a seperate 'parallax.css' file associated with it.
It contains the URL's for the background photos.
Most of the photos come from the direct photo link of Vera Mae's Facebook.

This was done to minmize memory usage on server and for efficiency of loading page on mobile.
Currently the parallax scrolling is handled under 'scroll.js', however scroll speeds were kept minimal because of difficulties on mobile devices.
